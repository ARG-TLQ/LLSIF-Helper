More info to come on this, but in the meantime, there is no testbench.  All the class header and implementation files are located in the Code folder in the / directory.

* Implement Score Match class.
* Implement Medley Festival class.
* Implement data storage to keep track of user's event history
* Add UI that is independent of Windows Forms.
